## Twine Between Topics

A (hopefully) collaboritive twine story focused on helping users find 2nd person story authors via a sort of faire or convention booth like setup.

### Contributing

Feel free to setup a booth to talk about your works! And, if you'd like you can also provide an example short story for the reader to try. Simply clone down this repo add your twine nodes (probably in Harlowe format), and then PR this repository with your additions. So long as the content is safe for work and the edits don't infringe upon the works of others it should be reviewed and accepted provided I have the time to do so, haha.

Feel free to also propose edits to the introduction. Since the intro is shared by all authors scrutiny on edits made here will be a little tighter though. We can probably vote on it over at the discord to see what people think :)

### How to setup a booth
Note! Make sure all of your nodes link back to your booth or to the courtyard so that readers can easily find the communal space again.

1. Create a new node and give it a descriptive title
2. Link the node to the courtyard commons (Twine Between Topics)
3. In the `Twine Between Topics` node create a link to your booth in the following format
  - `[[Go to (so-and-so's) booth]]
4. (optional) create a second link in `Twine Between Topics` that leads to a demo story of yours that can only be accessed after they visit your booth
  - This should be framed in such a way as the reader is journeying to your story feel free to take inspiration or utilize the provided landmarks in the introduction
